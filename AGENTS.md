## Development

When starting the dev server, use background mode with `--host` so it binds to all interfaces (not just IPv6 localhost):

```
astro dev --host --background
```

Manage the background server with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, and `astro dev logs`.

Without `--host`, the server binds to `[::1]:4321` only, which is unreachable from other machines on the network.
